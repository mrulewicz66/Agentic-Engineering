-prompt well - ak for short answers and latest APIs for today's date
-ask 2 LLMs the same question
-ask to break down your request into independently testable steps. Divide problem into small pieces and have LLM to solve problem in steps.
-ask an LLM then get another LLM to check
-ask for 3 solutions to the same problem, pick the best. Ask LLM to explain

5 Fundamental skills
	Thinking
	Framework
	Checkpoints
	Debugging
	Context

There are usually two modes we work in while coding:
	Implementing New Feature
		provide relevant context
		mention frameworks
		provide docs with explicit details
		making incremental changes
		doing the checkpoints
		version control
	
	Debugging Errors
		figure out how things work
		how to get it unstuck from LLM
		provide as much info as you can
		always limit code changes to a minimum
		rate limit API endpoints
		Create rules file to ensure AI is acting by best security practices, ect
