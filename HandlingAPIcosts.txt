Methods of handling API costs when designing agentic software for clients.

	1. Direct Cost Pass-Through
		Charge clients exactly what the API provider charges you. Best for clients seeking transparency and when API costs are stable.
		Pros: Full transparencyabout costs, Simple to administer.
		Cons: Fluctuations can dissatisfy client, No profit margin on API costs.
		
	2. Mark-Up on API Costs
		Add percentage or fixed markup to API base cost before charging client. Useful when you provide additional value (integration, customization, ect.).
		Pros: Generates additional revenue, Justified for additional services.
		Cons: Skeptical if aware of base costs, Transparency of the added value.
		
	3. Bundled Pricing
		Incorporate API costs into bundled price for the overall project. suitable for projects where APIs are part of a larger solution.
		Pros: Simplifies billing process, Single payment easier for clients.
		Cons: Reduces cost itemization, Misalignment of cost and usage.
		
	4. Subscription Model
		API services for fixed fee including certain level of usage over time period. Ideal for clients with regular, predictable API usage.
		Pros: Steady cash flow, Easier budgeting for clients.
		Cons: Adjustments based on actual usage, Potential for unused services.
		
	5. Tiered Usage Pricing
		Set different pricing levels based on the volume of API usage. Effective when usage varies and can be segmented into categories.
		Pros: Flexible for clients, Scalable revenue if use increases.
		Cons: Complexity in monitoring tiers, Frequent tier shift annoys clients.
		
	6. Performance-Based Pricing
		Price based on value generated by API-driven functionalities. Useful when you can directly link API performance to business outcomes.
		Pros: Aligns costs with value provided, Potentially higher returns.
		Cons: Quantifying performance metrics, Risk of disputes over value.
		
	7. Free Tier With Premium Services
		Basic API for free with advanced features for a fee. Great for encouraging adoption among new or hesitant clients.
		Pros: Lowers barriers for entry, Opportunities for upselling.
		Cons: Initial revenue loss from free users, Challenge in convincing to upgrade.
		
	In conclusion the Direct Cost Pass-Through method seems like the most useful because it's the easiest one to sell. The client understands that there is a service that you are using and paying for to enable or advance their product or service. The bundled seems like the worst because of how unpredictable it can be with future increased costs of API fees and could lead to a loss. The Mark-Up on API Costs seems like it would be the hardest to sell considering the lack of transparency and is overall a less ethical model.
